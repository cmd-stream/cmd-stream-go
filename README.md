cmd-stream-go is a high-performance client-server library for Go, built around 
the [Command pattern](https://ymz-ncnk.medium.com/command-pattern-as-an-api-architecture-style-be9ac25d6d94).

# Why cmd-stream-go?
It provides an extremely fast and flexible communication mechanism.

# Description
- Can work over TCP, TLS or mutual TLS.
- Has an asynchronous client that uses only one connection for both sending 
  Commands and receiving Results.
- Supports the server streaming, i.e. a Command can send back multiple Results
  (client streaming is not directly supported, but can also be implemented).
- Supports deadlines for sending Commands and Results.
- Supports reconnect feature.
- Supports keepalive feature.
- Supports the Circuit Breaker pattern.
- Supports OpenTelemetry.
- Can work with various serialization formats ([here](https://github.com/cmd-stream/cmd-stream-examples-go/tree/main/standard_protobuf) is an example using the Protobuf serializer).
- Has a modular architecture.

# Tests
The cmd-stream-go module includes only a few integration tests, while each 
submodule (see the [Architecture](#architecture) section) has approximately 90% 
test coverage.

- [OpenTelemetry integration](https://ymz-ncnk.medium.com/cmd-stream-go-with-opentelemetry-adeecfbe7987)

# Network Protocols Support
cmd-stream-go is built on top of Go's standard `net` package and supports 
connection-oriented protocols such as TCP, TLS, and mutual TLS (for client 
authentication).

# Client
The client is asynchronous and safe for concurrent use from multiple goroutines. 
It uses a single connection to send Commands and receive Results. Commands sent 
from a single goroutine are delivered to the server in order.

# Server
The server initiates the connection by sending `ServerInfo` to the client. The 
client uses this information to verify compatibility, such as ensuring both 
endpoints support the same set of Commands.

Each Command is executed by a single `Invoker` in a separete goroutine. Also a 
Command can send multiple Results back, all of which will be delivered to the 
client in order, [here's](https://github.com/cmd-stream/cmd-stream-examples-go/tree/main/multi_result) 
an example.

# High-performance Communication Channel
To build a high-performance communication channel between two services, consider 
the following guidelines:
1. Use N connections, as several connections can transfer significantly more 
   data than a single one. The optimal number, N, depends on your system and 
   represents the point after which adding more connections does not improve 
   performance.
2. To minimize latency, open all available connections at the start rather than 
   creating new ones on demand.
3. Keep connections alive to avoid the overhead of frequent connection setup and 
   teardown.

These practices, implemented via the `ClientGroup`, can significantly enhance 
throughput and reduce latency between your services.

# cmd-stream-go and RPC
If youâ€™re already using RPC, cmd-stream-go can improve performance by providing 
a faster communication mechanism. [Here's](https://github.com/cmd-stream/cmd-stream-examples-go/tree/main/rpc) 
an example.

# Architecture
There are the following cmd-stream-go submodules:
- [core-go](https://github.com/cmd-stream/core-go): The core module that 
- includes client and server definitions.
- [delegate-go](https://github.com/cmd-stream/delegate-go): The client delegates
  all communication-related tasks to its delegate, the server follows the same 
  approach. The connection is also initialized at this level.
- [handler-go](https://github.com/cmd-stream/handler-go): The server delegate 
  uses a handler to receive and process Commands.
- [transport-go](https://github.com/cmd-stream/transport-go): Resposible for 
  Commands/Results delivery.

cmd-stream-go was designed in such a way that you can easily replace any part of 
it.
